## Motivation

As a physics students, flight dynamics are not commonly taught as part of the course, so I decided to create a programme on Python to help me understand some of the basics, such as the concept of thrust required for level flight. I investigated this at different flight altitudes, and compared how minimum drag airspeed compares to the level flight mach for three different aircrafts: Airbus A320-200, Boeing 737-800, and Embraer E195.
